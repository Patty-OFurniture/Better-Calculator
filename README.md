# Calculator
A better windows calculator built in python which allows user to calculate exponents.


The build-in calculator app that comes with Windows only allows users to perform the four basic arithmatic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It does not easily allow users to calculate exponents or use parenthesis.

After continuously going to Google for exponent calculations, I decided to build a better calculator GUI that allows me to perform these operations. The calculator is built entirely in Python, using Tkinter for the GUI itself and cx_freeze to compile the file into an exe.

The calculator takes inputs in the form of button clicks and keyboard entries.
